# Introduction

Welcome to Vaultexe! An open-source self-hosted zero-knowledge **password manager**.

The project also serves as a production grade FastApi backend template aiming to teach concepts in

- System design
- Security
- API development
- DBMS
- Design patterns

## Why Vaultexe?

Vaultexe is not meant to replace your existing password manager... yetüòè

We wanted to build a production grade SAAS for our Senior Project and we wanted to build something that we would actually use.
Everyone loves a free password manager but we wanted to take it a step further and make our own, with our own features and style while maintaining the same level of security.
